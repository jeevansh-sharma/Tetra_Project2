The metrics you shared for your production Next.js application give a good sense of the performance. Here's a detailed breakdown and assessment:

Route Analysis
1. Home Page (/)
Size: 8.37 kB (very lightweight 👍)
First Load JS: 191 kB
Evaluation: A first load of 191 kB is acceptable for modern websites, but for optimal performance, aim for <170 kB on initial load for average connections (e.g., 4G).
2. About Us (/about_us)
Size: 3.84 kB (excellent size 👍)
First Load JS: 187 kB
Evaluation: Similar to the home page. The 187 kB payload is fine but can be reduced further if needed.
3. Not Found (/_not-found)
Size: 896 B (minimal 👍)
First Load JS: 101 kB
Evaluation: This is great for a fallback page. No significant concerns here.
4. Director (/director)
Size: 137 B (extremely lightweight 👍)
First Load JS: 100 kB
Evaluation: This is efficient for such a small page.
Shared Chunks
Size: 100 kB
Largest Chunk (52.5 kB): Could indicate a shared library or framework.
Second Chunk (45.5 kB): Likely another key dependency (e.g., React, UI framework, etc.).
Overall Evaluation
Good Points:

Individual page sizes are excellent (small and efficient).
Shared chunks are well-distributed, indicating proper code splitting.
Improvement Areas:

First Load JS (191 kB):
While it's not bad, reducing this further can improve performance, especially on slower networks (e.g., mobile).

Shared Chunk Size (100 kB):
This is acceptable, but analyzing the largest shared chunk (52.5 kB) could help you determine if it contains unnecessary dependencies.

How to Improve
1. Analyze and Optimize Shared Chunks
Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to break down what’s in the 52.5 kB chunk:
bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm run analyze
Look for opportunities to:
Remove unused dependencies.
Lazy-load rarely used code.
2. Tree-Shaking and Dead Code Elimination
Ensure tree-shaking is working correctly by using ES6 imports instead of CommonJS (require).
3. Optimize Third-Party Libraries
Replace large libraries with smaller alternatives if possible (e.g., lodash with lodash-es, moment.js with date-fns).
4. Reduce CSS and JS Payload
Ensure you're removing unused styles and JavaScript with tools like PurgeCSS.
5. Image Optimization
If your site uses images, ensure they are optimized using the next/image component, which automatically reduces image sizes.
6. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)
Pre-render as much content as possible to reduce runtime JS execution on the client.
Conclusion
Your current setup is good and production-ready, but you can aim for <170 kB First Load JS to optimize further. Reducing the largest shared chunk and eliminating unused code are key steps to achieving that.
